### How to Ping a list of Computer using PowerShell

If you are working as a System Administrator, sometimes you want to check your systems are alive or dead :) 
And simplest way to do this is PING command, but PING command working only for one computer/system. 
But you want to do this for 10-15 computers/systems.
Simple PING command can not solve this problem but PowerShell can.

***c:\> PowerShell.exe -File ping_computers.ps1 -ExecutionPolicy Bypass***
